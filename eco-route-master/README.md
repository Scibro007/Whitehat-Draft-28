### Air pollution tracker
This project aims to develop a smart embedded device that can measure the current Carbon monoxide (CO) levels and send that data to a cloud server. This data needs to be further displayed in the form of heatmaps, where the values are displayed in various levels, to know the pollution levels in different parts of the cities. We intend to measure other parameters as well such as temperature and humidity to understand if we can find any correlation between them and the CO levels. We also plan to develop an Android application which users can use to know the current CO levels surrounding them. Such a pollution transmitting device and be created by putting together small and cheap electronic sensors and having them continuously transmit their data through an Internet connection to a server.
