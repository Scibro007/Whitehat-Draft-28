/* This is a pollution and emmissions tracker i was able to make by sourcing various other apps and with
the help of another friend of mine Gabriel (credits to him in getAreaStats.js and helping me with the
python aspect of the program). 

    This is a fundamental piece to my plan of helping the enivironment by monitoring the emmisions of every
    vehicular device on the planet. A large scale project like this aims of internaional coopertaion to
    take one small step to achieve a betterment in our nature*/
